# The RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) Spec

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raml-org/raml-spec.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/raml-org/raml-spec)

**The current version of the RAML specification is 1.0 - and you can find it [here](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md).**

RAML is a language for the definition of HTTP-based APIs that embody most or all of the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). The RAML specification (this document) defines an application of the [YAML 1.1 specification](http://yaml.org/spec/1.1) that provides mechanisms for the definition of practically-RESTful APIs, while providing provisions with which source code generators for client and server source code and comprehensive user documentation can be created.

Why not pay us a visit on [raml.org](http://www.raml.org)? You will find tons of information around RAML such as a tutorial, what the RAML Workgroup is, RAML projects, a forum, and a lot more.

## What is the fastest way to get started?

All you need is an editor of your choice - we recommend either MuleSoft's [API Designer](https://github.com/mulesoft/api-designer) or [API Workbench](http://apiworkbench.com/); but any text editor will do just fine.

Now you only need to do is to write the design for your first endpoint

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0
title: Hello world # required title

/greeting: # optional resource
  get: # HTTP method declaration
    responses: # declare a response
      200: # HTTP status code
        body: # declare content of response
          application/json: # media type
            # structural definition of a response (schema or type)
            type: object
            properties:
              message: string
            example: # example how a response looks like
              message: "Hello world"
```
